The problems asks us to look at the given program, and find a precondition that will result in the
program completing without error, or `panic`ing.

Looking a bit closer at the program reveals that there are several statements that result in the program panicking.

...
if false { skip } else { panic };
...

Looking at the hint, we find an article on Wikipedia talking about weakest preconditions.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_transformer_semantics#Weakest_preconditions

...
wp(abort, R) => false
...

In other words, the precondition on the statement `abort` that will return `R` is false.

Input false into the server and get the flag.
