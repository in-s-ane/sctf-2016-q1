Decompiling the Cookie class found in the jar reveals the following bit of information:

    MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5");
    byte[] arr = digest.digest(new String(this.passwordField1.getPassword()).getBytes("UTF-8"));
    String md5 = new BigInteger(1, arr).toString(16);
    System.out.println(md5);
    String answer = "fdf87a05e2169b88a8db5a1ebc15fa50";
    if (md5.equals(answer)) {
        System.out.println("success! it's working!");
    }

The md5 hash of our input is being checked against the string `answer`, so let's try looking up the hash.

We get that the correct password is "thisisaverystrongpassword".

Inputting that into the text field gives us the flag:
sctf{g3t_y0ur_h4nd_0ut_0f_my_c00k13_j4r!}
