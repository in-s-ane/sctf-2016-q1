Running `binwalk` on the wav file reveals a hidden tiff file within, which we can extract with
`binwalk -e rain.wav`.

Opening up the tiff shows what looks to be a qr code, but it's all messed up.
Looking at the exif reveals the following:

...
History Parameters              : from image/png to image/tiff
...

If we convert the tiff back into an image (http://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-png), we get the four original
pieces of the qr code.

Stitch them together and scan the resulting qr code to get the flag.
