The website gives us a link to source.php. This might have a vulnerability. Apparently, we get the flag if the variable thepassword_123 is equal
to whatever we input as our password.

The variable password_123 is probably defined in secret.php, but the variable pass is obtained from extracting the data from the POST request.
extract($_POST) is where the vulnerability is, as we can redefine the
variables.

Doing curl -d "pass=hi&thepassword_123=hi" http://ducks.sctf.michaelz.xyz/
will give you the flag.
